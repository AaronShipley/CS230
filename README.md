1. This design Templat is for creating an application of the game Draw It or Lose It, by the compant The Gaming Room. It is a take on the 80's Gameshow game, Win,Lose or Draw. The app will be available on multiple paltforms, pre-loaded with 200 drawings. Multiple players and teams will play the game simultaneously.

2.  One thing I felt like I did particularly well in this design template was ensuring all parties would clearly understand each portion of the template, even if they are not familiar with software design. This is crucial in ensuring all parties understand the requirements, functionality and execution of the app.

3. One aspect of working through the design template to create the code that was very helpful was writing out what needed to be done and what requirement the app would have.  Articulating this in written sentences help me visualize what I needed to do for the code. It also helped me segment the code in pieces in order to partician my work and debug it one segment at a time.

4.  If I had to choose one area that I would revise in this document, it would be the section in recommendations about storage management. It was an area that I had to use alot of resources and reference a lot in writing my part. The resources helped me understand better what storage management was and how it works, but I need to better research in this area to better understand it even more, in order to speak more clearly to it. 

5.  Since the user needs were to be able to play the game simultaneously with other people and be available on multiple platforms, I answered this in my document, by suggesting a serverless, cloud-based system to run the application, while using a Linux OS that would be managable , secure and fit the user's needs best in my opinion.

6. I would definetely use my strategy of segmenting the work, writing the design template first, and alotting myself ample time to write the software. Ample time is crucial. Being a novice to programming, I must take my time and fully dive in to the code writing. It seems that it takes me a bit to get going on it, but once I fit the first few pieces to the puzzle together, I have something to build off of.
